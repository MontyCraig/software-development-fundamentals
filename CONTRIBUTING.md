# Contributing

Welcome, and thank you for considering a contribution to this project. This
repository is a language-agnostic reference for software development
fundamentals, and we appreciate help from anyone who shares that goal.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** this repository to your own account.
2. **Create a branch** with a descriptive name (e.g., `add-graph-algorithms`).
3. **Make your changes**, following the content standards below.
4. **Commit** with a clear, concise message describing what you changed and why.
5. **Open a pull request** against the `main` branch. Include a brief summary
   of your changes and reference any related issues.

## Content Standards

All content in this repository must follow these rules strictly:

- **Completely language-agnostic.** Do not reference specific programming
  languages, frameworks, libraries, or tools. Concepts should be explained in
  universal terms that apply regardless of implementation technology.
- **Universal pseudocode conventions.** All code examples must use the following
  keywords: `FUNCTION`, `END FUNCTION`, `SET`, `IF`/`THEN`/`ELSE`/`END IF`,
  `FOR EACH`/`DO`/`END FOR`, `WHILE`/`DO`/`END WHILE`, `RETURN`, `APPEND`,
  `PRINT`. Do not use syntax from any specific language.
- **ASCII diagrams** for all visual concepts. Do not use images or external
  diagram tools. Diagrams must render correctly in any plain-text viewer.
- **No external dependencies.** The content should be fully self-contained and
  readable as plain text or rendered markup.

## File Template

Each topic file should contain the following sections in order:

1. **Overview** -- What the concept is and why it matters.
2. **Key Concepts** -- Core definitions, terminology, and principles.
3. **Pseudocode Examples** -- Working pseudocode using the conventions above.
4. **Visual Diagrams** -- ASCII art illustrating structures, flows, or
   relationships.
5. **Complexity Analysis** -- Time and space complexity where applicable.
6. **When to Use / When Not to Use** -- Practical guidance on applicability.
7. **Real-World Applications** -- Concrete scenarios where the concept applies
   (described generically, without naming specific products or tools).
8. **Common Pitfalls** -- Mistakes that are frequently made.
9. **Practice Problems** -- At least four problems for the reader to solve.

Not every section will be equally relevant to every topic, but each file should
include all nine sections even if some are brief.
