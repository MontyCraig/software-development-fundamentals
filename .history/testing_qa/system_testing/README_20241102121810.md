# System Testing

## Overview
System testing evaluates the complete and integrated software system to verify it meets specified requirements.

## Components

### 1. End-to-End Testing
- Functional Testing
  - Business flow validation
  - User journey testing
  - Cross-functional testing
- System Integration
  - Component interaction
  - External system integration
  - Data flow validation
- User Interface Testing
  - UI/UX validation
  - Cross-browser testing
  - Responsive design testing

### 2. Performance Testing
- Load Testing
  - Concurrent users
  - Transaction throughput
  - Response times
- Stress Testing
  - System boundaries
  - Breaking points
  - Recovery testing
- Scalability Testing
  - Horizontal scaling
  - Vertical scaling
  - Resource utilization

### 3. Security Testing
- Vulnerability Assessment
  - Security scanning
  - Penetration testing
  - Risk assessment
- Authentication Testing
  - Access control
  - User permissions
  - Session management
- Data Security
  - Encryption
  - Data privacy
  - Compliance testing

## Implementation Examples
